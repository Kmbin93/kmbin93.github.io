I am a senior engineer in High Performance Computing Research Lab at [Samsung SDS Research](https://www.samsungsds.com/en/technology-research/research-areas.html). My research goal is to make AI systems faster, more efficient, and scalable. I'm currently working on designing memory-efficient LLM serving systems and LLM quantization.
