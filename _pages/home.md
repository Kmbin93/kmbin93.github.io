I am a Ph.D student advised by [Kyunghan Lee](https://nxc.snu.ac.kr/people/advisor) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University. I'm currently in the [Networked Computing Lab (NXC)](https://nxc.snu.ac.kr/home). My research interests are 
mobile computing, mobile deep learning and split computing.
